scourges on the planet, offenses against hardworking programmers that have
pushed out sensible formats (like JSON) in favor of overly-complicated hairballs
with no basis in reality (I’m not done yet!—more on this in chapter 5).

>	JSON (pronounced like “Jason”), for the uninitiated, is a simple format for
exchanging basic pieces of data between software. Originally based on JavaScript
but quickly adopted by nearly every major language, it makes it easy to share data
over the Web.

> 	Wait!, you may cry, I thought XML was for sharing data on the Web. Sadly,
you have been misled by a sinister and harmful public relations campaign. XML is
probably just about the worst format for sharing data. Here’s why:
